## üîÑ Component Reusability & Anti-Duplication

### Component Design Principles
- **Design components for reusability** from the start - avoid creating similar components
- **Use composition over duplication** - combine smaller components to create variations
- **Implement variant-based design** - single component with multiple visual states
- **Create configurable components** with props instead of hardcoded variations
- **Use component inheritance patterns** for shared functionality

### Component Architecture Patterns
- **Base component approach** - create foundational components that can be extended
- **Variant prop patterns** - use size, color, and style variants within single components
- **Compound component patterns** - combine components for complex functionality
- **Render prop patterns** - for flexible component behavior customization
- **Higher-order component patterns** - for shared logic across multiple components

### Preventing Component Duplication
- **Code review standards** that flag similar component creation
- **Component library audit** before creating new components
- **Shared component documentation** to promote discoverability and reuse
- **Component naming conventions** that indicate purpose and reusability
- **Regular refactoring sessions** to consolidate similar components

### Reusability Guidelines
- **Make components configurable** through props rather than creating variants
- **Use theme props** for styling variations instead of separate components
- **Implement flexible layouts** that adapt to different content and contexts
- **Create component composition APIs** for complex functionality
- **Document component variations** and use cases for team reference

### Component Organization
- **Centralized component library** in shared directory structure
- **Component categorization** by function and reusability level
- **Version control** for component API changes and backwards compatibility
- **Component testing standards** that ensure reusability across contexts
- **Regular component inventory** to identify duplication opportunities

### Refactoring Strategies
- **Identify similar components** during code reviews and planning
- **Extract common patterns** into shared base components
- **Consolidate styling approaches** using theme-based variations
- **Merge functionality** of components that serve similar purposes
- **Create migration guides** when consolidating existing components

- **Use descriptive variable names** with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError, canSubmit)
- **Follow atomic design principles**: atoms ‚Üí molecules ‚Üí organisms ‚Üí templates ‚Üí pages

### File Structure Standards
```
features/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stores/
